function theta = subspace(A,B)
%SUBSPACE Angle between subspaces.
%   SUBSPACE(A,B) finds the angle between two
%   subspaces specified by the columns of A and B.
%
%   If the angle is small, the two spaces are nearly linearly
%   dependent.  In a physical experiment described by some
%   observations A, and a second realization of the experiment
%   described by B, SUBSPACE(A,B) gives a measure of the amount
%   of new information afforded by the second experiment not
%   associated with statistical errors of fluctuations.
%
%   Class support for inputs A, B:
%      float: double, single

%   The algorithm used here ensures that both small and 
%   large (i.e. close to pi/2) angles are
%   computed accurately, and it allows subspaces of different
%   dimensions following the definition in [2]. The first issue
%   is crucial.  The second issue is not so important; but
%   since the definition from [2] coinsides with the standard
%   definition when the dimensions are equal, there should be
%   no confusion - and subspaces with different dimensions may
%   arise in problems where the dimension is computed as the
%   numerical rank of some inaccurate matrix.
%
%   MATLAB's subspace Rev. 5.5-5.8 fails to provide correct answers
%   for angles smaller than e-8. 
%   MATLAB's subspace Rev. 5.9-5.10.4.3 fails to provide correct answers
%   for angles close to pi/2, makes unnecessary data copying 
%   and has a for loop that should have been vectorized
%
%   For a more general code, which computes all angles
%   and corresponding canonical vectors in a general scalar product, see
