% mean variance for H, LA and S

% here we want to summarize results of the entire data set into a sigle
% data information. We do that by computing mean and variance (std) of the
% reconstruction error of H, LA and S to evaluate if they correspond to our
% hypoteses. 

% We should also try doing that with subpopulation (impairment >=..., D and
% F and so on)
