This folder contains kinematic data acquired from healthy subjects (subfolder Healthies) and impaired subjects (subfolder Strokes). 
Signals were acquired through the Xsens' MVN motion tracking system, and data are provided in the proprietary format ".mvnx".
Each mvnx-file represents one trial execution and is named according to the participant ID (e.g. P02), task number (T01-T30), tested upper limb(R/L) and repetition(1-3).
The file structure is explained in the Xsens MVN User Manual pp92-96.Â 
Matlab code to access and plot data, adapted from the developers tool of Xsens, is also provided (see main_mvnx_adapted.m).
On the developer's website it is also possible to donwload tools to load data on Excel.
