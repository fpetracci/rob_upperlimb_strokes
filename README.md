# rob_upperlimb_strokes
This repository contains all needed code to handle the post-stroke UZH dataset and perform fPCA and rPCA analysis. 
Check README_DATA_ANALYSIS.txt to have more info.

It also contains the developed code to run the supplementary exercises: 
- Dynamic Control of a Franka robot and a KUKA robot using Computed Torque, BackStepping and their adaptive versions.
- Analysis of an Overhead Crane, an underactuated non linear system
- Feedback Linearization Control of an Overhead Crane
Other simpler non linear systems have been study to validate the developed code.


-----------------------------
The repository is organized in folders as follows:
-	Data Analysis				all needed code to handle the post-stroke UZH dataset. The dataset is not included.
-	Mathematica - Ergonomy		Mathematica code to build a CLIK algorithm that keeps in mind ergonomicity.
-	rvctools					Peter Corke robotic toolbox, 9th release 
-	Tavole						developed code to run the supplementary exercises. Parts in italian to ease the development.
-	Tex							.tex files for the final report.
